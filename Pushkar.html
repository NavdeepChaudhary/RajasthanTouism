<p><h3>With more than 52 bathing ghats dotting its perimeter, Pushkar Lake stands as the most prominent and magnificent landmark of this town. Legend has it that the lake was created when Brahma (the creator of the universe as per the Hindu scriptures) dropped a lotus at this spot. As such, it is a sacred water body for Hindus, who come from afar to take a dip in it and get purged of their sins and cured of skin diseases</h3></p>
<li><h2> Rangji Temple, Pushkar</h2></li>

<p><h3>A unique feature of the Ranji Temple is that it exhibits South Indian architectural style, which is not common in Pushkar. But the grandeur of the temple is unmistakable. This popular place of worship is dedicated to Lord Rangii, an incarnation of Lord Vishnu. The temple dates back to 1823 and is considered to be among the new temples of Pushkar.</h3></p>

<p><h3>Pushkar is often referred to as the Rose Garden of Rajasthan due to the rose farming done there. You can take some time off and pay a visit to one of the rose farms and watch the lovely flowers in bloom. It will be a delight to take a look at the various varieties of rose plants filling up acres of farmland and spreading their fragrance.</h3></p>
